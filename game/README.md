## About the project
I have made this game using Canvas and JavaScript.

## How to play?
* This is a simple game which can be played on desktop.
* You can use left and right arrow keys or mouse to move the paddle.
* This is a simple Bouncing Ball Game in which you have to break the brick with ball without hitting the floor.
* If the ball touches the ground then the message "GAME OVER!!!" appears with your final score.
* If you break all the bricks then the message "Congractulation you won the game!!!" appears.
